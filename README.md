# WordPress plugin test

the test task is really simple, it should take about 2 hours. you need to create a wp plugin which will consist of a form with two fields - number A and number B, and a submit button. on submit, the data needs to be sent to a symfony api, which will calculate A / B and return the response which will be shown to the client. that's it.
